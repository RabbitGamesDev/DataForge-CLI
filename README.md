**DataForge CLI** helps automate that process.

```

Enter the project folder:

```bash
cd DataForge-CLI/dataforge-cli
```

```

---

## Option 2 — Download as ZIP

If you don't use Git:

1. Open this repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Code**.
3. Click **Download ZIP**.
4. Extract the ZIP anywhere on your computer.
5. Open a terminal inside the **dataforge-cli** folder.
6. Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. Run the application:

---

## 🔑 Configure your Groq API Key

DataForge requires a Groq API Key to communicate with the AI model.

Getting one only takes a minute.

1. Visit **https://console.groq.com/**
2. Sign in or create a free account.
3. Open **API Keys**.
4. Click **Create API Key**.
5. Copy your key.

The first time DataForge starts it will ask for your API Key and save it locally on your computer.

Your key is never uploaded to GitHub and is automatically ignored by `.gitignore`.

---

# 🚀 Using DataForge from Anywhere (Windows)

After installing DataForge you may want to execute it from any folder without navigating to the project directory every time.

You can do this by creating a small launcher.

Create a file called:

```text
dataforge.bat
```

Paste the following content inside it:

```bat
@echo off
python "C:\PATH\TO\DataForge-CLI\dataforge-cli\main.py" %*
```

Replace the path with the location where **main.py** is stored on your computer.

Save the file.

You can either:

- keep it inside your own tools folder,
- or place it inside a folder that exists in your Windows PATH.

After that, simply open any terminal and type:

```bash
dataforge
```

or

```bash
dataforge scan .
```

without navigating to the DataForge directory.

---

# 💻 Basic Usage

Open a terminal inside the project you want to analyze.

Examples:

Analyze the current project:

```bash
dataforge scan .
```

Explain a specific file:

```bash
dataforge explain main.py
```

Generate the architecture map:

```bash
dataforge map .
```

Start an interactive AI session:

```bash
dataforge ask
```

Generate onboarding documentation:

```bash
dataforge onboard .
```

Need help?

Simply type:

```bash
dataforge
```

or

```bash
dataforge help
```

to display the list of available commands.

---

# 💻 First Run

The first execution only happens once.

DataForge will ask for:

- Your Groq API Key
- Preferred language
- Terminal theme

After that, your configuration is saved automatically.

Future launches skip this setup.
